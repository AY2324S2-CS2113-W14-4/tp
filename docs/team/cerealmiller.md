## Project: Voyagers
Voyagers is a Java application designed to track and manage a user's trips (i.e. events). Through a CLT-based UI, the
user can add, edit, delete, and track the statuses of their trips. Additional features such as giving each trip a review
and tracking bills/payments associated with each trip are also provided.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
