# Developer Guide - Voyagers

## Acknowledgements

This project is a team effort by the NUS CS2113 Group W14-4

## Setting Up, Getting Started

Run the JAR File, then follow the prompts through the command-line interface. Refer to this guide for syntax.

## Design & implementation

The Voyagers application is designed as a command-line interface 
(CLI) tool for managing travel trips. 
It is implemented in Java and follows a modular architecture to promote scalability and maintainability.

### Normal flow of the application

The application starts by displaying a welcome message. Then the flow is as follows:

1. The user is prompted to enter a command.
2. The application processes the command and displays the appropriate output.
3. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated until the user enters the `exit` command.

The implementation of this flow is made using four main classes: `Parser`, `Commands`, `Storage` and `Ui`.
With these classes we can encapsulate the whole logic of the application in a relative simple loop.

````java
                                    ...
  while (!isExit) {
            try {
                String fullCommand = ui.readCommand();
                Command c = NewParser.parse(fullCommand);
                c.execute(tripList, ui, null);
                isExit = c.isExit();

            } catch (Exception e) { 
                ui.echo(e.getMessage());
            }
        }
                                ...
````

The following UML sequence diagram shows the flow of the application when the user enters a command.

![Sequence Diagram](diagrams/seq_diagram_flow.png)

### Commands

As shown in the sequence diagram, commands are encapsulated in the `Command` class.
This class is abstract and each command is implemented in a subclass of `Command`.

The `Command` class has the following structure:

````java
public abstract class Command {
    protected boolean isExit = false;
    public abstract void execute(TripList tripList, Ui ui, Storage storage) throws VoyagersException;
    public boolean isExit() {
        return isExit;
    }
}
````

The main logic of each command is implemented in the `execute` method. 

### Parser

To parser the user input into a command we have implemented a `Parser` class. 
This parser is quite generic and easy to extend to include new commands.

The parser works with another class called 'ParserDefinition'. This class is a simple data structure that contains the
expected arguments for each command.

### Simplifying bills: minimizing number of transactions.

Each trip can have multiple bills associated. We have decided to include a functionality to simplify the bills
from a trip. This means that we will try to minimize the number of transactions between the participants of the trip.

The implementation uses a graph algorithm to find the minimum number of transactions between the participants of the trip.
The code has been adapted to the one found in the following [link](https://medium.com/@mithunmk93/algorithm-behind-splitwises-debt-simplification-feature-8ac485e97688).

The next diagram shows the flow of the application after the user enters the `simplifybills` command.

## Bill
Bill implements Payable, an interface to be used a few times in this project to cover 
actions involving payment. It is dependent on the Profile and Trip classes, and Parser
is dependent on the Bill class. The commands currently supported are `addbill`, `paybill`, `listbills`, and 
`setbillcurrency`. 

The following UML diagram shows the flow of the application after the user enters the `addbill` command
with the correct arguments.

![Sequence Diagram](diagrams/diag_add_bill.png)

## Review
The Review class, instantiated solely by the Trip object. 
It enables users to assign trip ratings (1-10) in Review's 'int score' attribute and input personal reflections and 
encapsulates individual sentiments in Review's 'String reflection attribute, facilitating comprehensive user feedback.
Currently, Reviews are not stored when the app exits, this implementation is planned.

## Status
When a trip is cancelled, the status of the trip is changed to 'cancelled'. Otherwise, the trip will be 'completed', 
'ongoing' or 'upcoming'. Depending on the starting and ending time of the trip.

## Product scope
